### usage

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
It uses Webpack4 and babel to compile React.

Run `npx webpack` after `npm install` has done successfully.

`main.js` and `main.css` will be created inside of `dist` directory by running `npx webpack` (this command is just test command. you will use `npm run watch` for develop).
